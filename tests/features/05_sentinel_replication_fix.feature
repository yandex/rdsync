Feature: Sentinel mode broken replication fix

    Scenario: Sentinel mode broken shard with divergence in DCS and redis is fixed
        Given sentinel shard is up and running
        Then redis host "redis1" should be master
        And redis host "redis2" should become replica of "redis1" within "15" seconds

        And redis host "redis3" should become replica of "redis1" within "15" seconds
        And replication on redis host "redis3" should run fine within "15" seconds
        And zookeeper node "/test/active_nodes" should match json_exactly within "30" seconds
