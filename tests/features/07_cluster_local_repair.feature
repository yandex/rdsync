Feature: Cluster mode local node repair

    Scenario: Cluster mode replica is restarted after OOM

        And replication on redis host "redis3" should run fine within "15" seconds
        And zookeeper node "/test/active_nodes" should match json_exactly within "30" seconds

        When redis on host "redis2" is killed
        And I wait for "300" seconds
        Then redis host "redis2" should become available within "120" seconds
